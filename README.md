# 2. Tech stack of the project

-   React - Popular framework with a great community support it also offers great flexibility and variety of open source components to choose from.

-   Typescript - Typing solves major uncaught issues in the compilation stage itself so choose typescript (Might be an issue if you are majorly dealing with dynamic data set )

-   antd - Considering the time limit of the challenge building all the components from scratch is not feasible so opted for one of the popular React UI library.

-   tailwindCSS - Same consideration for time limit I opted for tailwind for the configurations and ease of use

-   Recharts - While dealing with multitude of data it make sense to view the data in the form of charts to draw insights into it.

# P.S This website was done on a very short amount of time atmost I would have put 5 ot 6 hours working on it
